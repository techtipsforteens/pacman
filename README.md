<h1>Pacman</h1>
This is an HTML/Javascript version of Pacman made completely from scratch.

<h2>To Play...</h2>
Go to <a href="https://betas.techtipsforteens.com/pacman/">here</a>. (You will need arrow keys to move around.)

<h2>To install to your web server...</h2>
<em>Note: You only have to do this is you want to tweak around with the code.</em><br><br>
<code>cd THE DIRECTORY OF YOUR WEB SERVER</code><br>
<code>mkdir pacman</code><br>
<code>cd pacman</code><br>
<code>git clone https://github.com/techtipsforteens/pacman.git</code><br><br>
Or just download the zip and extract the files to your web server.<br>

No additional steps needed, it's just plain HTM/CSS/Javascript.
